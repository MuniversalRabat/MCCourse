Learning to Minecraft, this is a storage file of the lessons and experiments I am doing to learn more.

There is probably nothing particularly impressive here yet, and some of it may seem questionable...
but please keep in mind, this is all for the advancement of Minecrafting and to get the hang of various
ways to use this system.

So thank you for your patience, and mind the dust.
